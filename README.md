Smart Farming Automation with AI-Powered Plant Monitoring
Overview
This project integrates IoT and AI to create an intelligent farming system. Using Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi, along with pH, humidity, and other sensors, it enables real-time monitoring of environmental conditions. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to detect plant infections, enhancing precision agriculture.

Features
IoT Integration: Uses ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino for data acquisition.
Sensor Monitoring: Tracks pH, humidity, temperature, and more.
AI-Based Disease Detection: CNN model identifies plant infections.
Automated Actions: Triggers alerts and controls based on conditions.
Technologies Used
Hardware: Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi
Sensors: pH, Humidity, Temperature, CO2, etc.
Software: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
Connectivity: MQTT, HTTP, Web Dashboard
